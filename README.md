## ESBN Transformer (wip)

An attempt to merge <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=LSFCEb3GYU7">ESBN</a> with Transformers, to endow Transformers with the ability to emergently bind symbols and improve extrapolation. The resulting architecture will be benchmarked with the Give-N task as outlined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10577">this paper</a>, commonly used to assess whether a child has acquired an understanding of counting.
